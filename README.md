## Near Future
The project is under development. The minimal functionality of the application is now available. We plan to develop:
- Transferring the editor to the graphical interface
- Adding functionality to work with content such as: videos, games and much more
- Connecting libraries for more convenient and functional reading of projects
- Add Heads-Up Display, HUD (rolling project variables)
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [React-particals] - A lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles.
- [Recharts] - A composable charting library built on React components
- [React-d3-graph] - awesome  graphics library for interacting with graphs
- [node.js] - cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
- [Redux] - A predictable state container for JavaScript applications


And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
